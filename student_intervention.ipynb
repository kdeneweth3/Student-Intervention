    "### Notes to the reviewer: Important lessons learned\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the suggestions made from the first reviewer I noticed many changes happening. The changes at first seemed they would be subtle but ultimately produced significant differences in my results.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original 3 classifiers were Decision trees, Adaboost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. All of my original answers were based on those classifers. After making the suggested changes I almost felt it necessary to change many of answers for the project. However, even though I have learned a lot from these few changes, I do not think it would be beneficial to change all of my orginal written answers such as, explaining why I chose my 3 original classifers. Instead, I will explain here what changes I made and how they affected my final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stratify\n",
    "The first change I made was stratifying the data when splitting the data into the cross validation groups (training and test sets). The stratify parameter is used to keep the percentage of labels for the target the same or very similar between the train and test sets. Before using this parameter the graduation rate for the training set was about 68% while it was only about 63% for the test set. After stratifying, the graduation rate was approximately 67% for both the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really noticed the affects of this change in the scores for my untuned classifers. Originally, my adaboost classfier performed the best at about 0.782, then the Bayes classifier was second best at 0.7634. I then tuned the adaboost classifer to get a score of 0.8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the parameter, the new best score came from the Bayes classifer at 0.7761, second was the adaboost at only 0.7328 (almost 5% drop!).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benchmarks\n",
    "Next I added benchmarks. The first was to see the score we would get if we predicted that everyone was to pass. This came to 0.8030. The next benchmark was using a logistic regression with a score of 0.7500. None of my classifiers performed better than predicting all students to pass (yikes!), although the Bayes did perform better than the logistic regression classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lead me to try the SVM classifer (SVC) to see if I could obtain a better score to beat the benchmark. The untuned SVC did perform better than the benchmark. The results of the tuned SVC are at the bottom where we compare the untuned and tuned models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base_estimator\n",
    "While the documentation for adaboost says that the DecionsionTreeClassifier is the default base estimator, when actually specifying it as such it gives a lower score. The only reason I added it was so that I could tune the parameter of the adaboost and decision tree in the CVSearch parameter tunes. This lead me to add both, the original adaboost classifier (without specifying the base_estimator) and to add another adaboost with the base_estimator set to a decisiontreeclassifier. I still have some digging to do to find out why there is a diffence. This taught me it is important to set the parameters I am making assumptions about, such as setting the base_estimator to DecisionTreeClassifier or knowing for certain what the default base_estimator is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SVC\n",
    "I did tune the SVC and compare results at the very bottom. However, I did not add the SVC to all the other questions."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision trees \n",
    "  - General\n",
    "    - They are good in situations with many features that contain different types of data such as binary and numerical.\n",
    "    - Classification decision trees are represented by a set of if-then rules which leads to a decision\n",
    "    - To build this tree\n",
    "      - The tree is built starting from the top. The first node it creates is one that has has the most information gain. That is, the one that most closely splits the data in half. To tell how much information will be gained we look at the entropy of the data. Entropy measures the homogeneity of the data. The data starts with high entropy (mixed data). We will gain the most information by minimizing the entropy as close to 0 as we can get.\n",
    "      - Once we have our first node, it's corresponding data is split into subsets. \n",
    "      - New nodes will be created with the subsets. Attributes can't be reused. Once there are no more attributes to split on the algoritm is done.\n",
    "  - Industry\n",
    "    - Direct marketing campaign success\n",
    "    - Which gas field to invest in\n",
    "  - Advantages\n",
    "    - handling messy data\n",
    "    - ability to deal with irrelevant features by generally ignoring them and select relevant ones first\n",
    "    - Disadvantages\n",
    "      - often achieve a lower generalization accuracy (which is why I will pair it with boosting\n",
    "  - Why I chose\n",
    "    - It's good at data with many features and mixed data types. That is the type of data that we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensemble learning (I will specifically use Adaboost)\n",
    "  - General\n",
    "    - Ensemble learners are a combination of many classifiers that are trained on small sets of data.\n",
    "    - They are composed of 'weak' learners. Weak learners are those that only have to perform better with an accuracy just over 1/2 (i.e. have an error rate less than 1/2).\n",
    "    - With each iteration the algorithm puts more weight on the labels that are wrong. And since we are using a weak learner, there will be information gain and some reduction in error, even if it is small.\n",
    "    - These weak learners are combined using a weighted average (majority vote) technique.\n",
    "    - When combined like this the algorithm can produce more accurate results than a single classifier can.\n",
    "  - Industry\n",
    "    - Since the base algorithm that was chosen here is a decision tree, those would be the industry examples for ensemble learning as well\n",
    "    - Another example for decision trees would be assessing cost effectiveness in clinical research\n",
    "  - Strengths\n",
    "    - It's quick (computationally efficient)\n",
    "    - no difficult parameters to set\n",
    "    - versatile - wide range of base learners can be used, such as decision trees\n",
    "  - Weaknesses\n",
    "    - susceptible to uniform noise\n",
    "    - weak learner should not be too complex to avoid overfitting\n",
    "    - needs to be enough data so that the weak learning requirement is satisfied\n",
    "    - Why I chose\n",
    "      - Decision trees are good for this type of data set (many features with mixed data). Ensemble methods, specifically I will use AdaBoost, can use decision trees as its base to improve the accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bayesian inference\n",
    "  - General\n",
    "    - Bayes' rule allows us to make decisions when facing uncertainty. It allows us to use prior information with our data to come up with new information that we can use to confirm our possible suspicions.\n",
    "  - Industry\n",
    "    - Used for email spam identification\n",
    "    - Forcasting insurance loss payments\n",
    "  - Strengths\n",
    "    - very efficient for training\n",
    "    - performs well on many different training tasks (not sure what that means)\n",
    "  - Weaknesses\n",
    "    - assumes strong conditional independence, example: will not predict XOR classification accurately\n",
    "  - Why I chose\n",
    "    - I will use a naive bayes classifier because it is computationally efficient and because we can use our prior information to classify future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why I didn't choose others\n",
    "- SVM: better used with binary classifiers in 2 groups\n",
    "- Neural nets: no sklearn library\n",
    "- k nearest neighbors: curse of dimensionality, need exponentially more data as we add features\n"

    "- The adaboost classifier is the best model for predicting who is likely to pass or fail. Based on the available data it is the classifer that scores the highest and will most accurately make the predictions we are looking for. While the adaboost was the least efficient in terms of computing resources, the value it creates with a significantly better performance outweights the added computational resources. However, it is important to point out that while the adaboost classifier has the highest cost in regards to computing resources, the actual resouces it needs are still negligable.

The students will work on the project one-at-a-time and each will have a different part, or section, of the project to work on. After each student is done, the teacher will grade how well the previous student did. After grading, the next student is going to work on their part of the project. However there is a catch, while it might not be completly fair, the next student is going to have to work on all the areas that the first student received a poor grade (in this example the poor grades are associated with the hardest part of the project) and very little in other 'easier' areas of the project.\n",
